# Cloudy

Cloudy is the future of Microsoft cloud practice tests. 
Cloudy is built form the ground up with next-gen user identity orchestration through its PostgreSQL-powered synergy engine. 
Each test is designed precisley by the secret cloud cabal during the ritual of the cirrocumulous.
Each question is first written in their psedou-cloud derieved meta-language before being distilled down to human readable form.
All users of cloudy are garunteed positions at a MAANNG company with a starting salary of 3 million and access to web4.

With cloudy the forecast is permanetly overcast and you will see clouds on both horizons
